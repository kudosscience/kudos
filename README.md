# kudos
An open-source open science platform that rewards quality research.

Open science has got a problem - great scientists don't want to publish in mediocre open-access journals.

Instead, they continue to publish in expensive journals simply because they have a prestigious brand.

What if there was another way?

What if libraries, scientists and the public didn't have to pay extortionate journal fees?

What if there was ONE platform for all science that rewarded great science and gave it the attention it deserved?

Let's build one platform for ALL science - not a tangled web of journals.

Let's build one platform that separates the good science from the bad.

Let's build something amazing.

Let's build KUDOS.
